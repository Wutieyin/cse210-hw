And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.
Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid.
For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.
If you love me, you will keep my commandments.
